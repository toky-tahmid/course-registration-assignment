3.Cart: Users can view the courses they've selected in a shopping cart see the remaining credits and the total cost.

Question 2-Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project

Ans:
I managed the first state with an empty array because the fake data started with an array, when dealing with numeric data then i put a initial value 0 The state starts as { count: 0 } because i just want a number for how many times the user clicked, so i pass 0 as initial state.
